## REST Services || REST APIs

- Client-Server Architecture 
  - *Client*  is a frontend part 
  - *Server* is a backend part 
  - Client can directly call the services by sending HTTP Requests 
  -  Http request is done by HTTP protocol 
-  **REST** is short of  **RE**presentational  **S**tate **T**ransfer 
-  **API** is short of **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface 
-  **REST** is basically convention for building http services 
-  We simple use http protocol princple to provide support **CRUD** Operations on data
-  CRUD is short of **C**reate - **R**ead - **U**pdate - **D**elete 
-  HTTP Methods 
   -  *GET* for getting data
